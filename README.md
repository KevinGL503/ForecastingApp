# Power Prices Forecasting App

This app attempts to predict prices for the ERCOT power market at different zones, 
based on historical data.
This predictions will be made using model such linear regression, gradient 
boosting, etc..


## Data (Plan)
For now, we attempt to predict these prices based on the following historical data:
* [ ] Demand (load)
* [ ] Wind and Solar power generation
* [ ] Prices for different hub zones

**Other data can can be added and used as we go..**

## Models (Plan)
Once we have the data we can start experimenting with models, 
for now, maybe linear regression or gradient boosting

## FrontEnd/Presentation (Plan)
We can display graphs showing the daily price predictions based on the current
day conditions and forecasts provided by ERCOT
