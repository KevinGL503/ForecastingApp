# Power Prices Forecasting App
This app attempts to predict prices for the ERCOT power market at different zones, 
based on historical data.

these models have been trained and called when needed.


## Data 
For now, we attempt to predict these prices based on the following historical data:
* Demand (load)
* Wind and Solar power generation
* Prices for different hub zones

**Other data can can be added and used as we go..**

## Models
Once we have the data we can start experimenting with models, 
for now, maybe linear regression or gradient boosting

## Purpose
Make is easier to get a prediction of the prices for the ERCOT market in one page
